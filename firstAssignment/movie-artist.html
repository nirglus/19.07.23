    <h1>Paul Walker</h1>
<h6>The Fast and The Furious - <small>2001</small></h6>
<p>Paul William Walker IV (September 12, 1973 â€“ November 30, 2013) was an American actor. He was best known for his role as Brian O'Conner in the Fast & Furious franchise.</p>
<p>Walker died in a single-vehicle collision on November 30, 2013, as a passenger in a speeding car. His father and daughter filed separate wrongful death lawsuits against Porsche, which resulted in settlements. At the time of his death, Walker had not completed filming Furious 7 (2015); it was released after rewrites and stand-ins, including his brothers Cody and Caleb, both of whom filled in for Walker, while the song "See You Again" by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth was commissioned as a tribute.</p>
